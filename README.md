The caltech_thesis Class
========================

NOTE: This isn't done yet! There are bugs to be worked out before it is
useful!

*caltech_thesis* is a modern, updated document class for writing Caltech
PhD theses in LaTeX. It is based on the memoir class, and makes several
choices regarding formatting that I prefer. 

I'm hoping that by having it publicly accessible on Github, it will be
useful to as many people as possible, and through contributions of others,
pull requests, and perhaps forks, may remain up-to-date and coherent,
instead of fracturing into numerous outdated versions with some changes 
strewn across the internet. To that end, if you make improvements, please
submit them as pull requests; I'll try to either keep this updated or pass
on maintainership to someone else.

Note that my actual thesis did not use exactly this class: the fonts were
slightly different, and different weights were used for various elements.
